This app is a simple quiz made to celebrate birthday of my brother in law. His name is Wilson (A.K.A Nem) =)

I was starting in a Android Development course when i made this app, 
and i tried to apply all knowledge i had in that time according to course and my searchs about.
This app was made in September 14, 2021 and was my first app using Kotlin.

I learned a lot and enjoyied as well.

I have  6 years in web development, in last 3 years as fullstack developer and i've decided to 
migrate to Android Development because i always loved mobile development and i'm a good moment to change my total focus to Android.
